Project: QA
-----------
This solution is used to smoke test an installed instance of Hotcakes Commerce before any release to ensure that there are no new issues created as a result of changes made to the core or cms Hotcakes solutions.

On occassion, this solution may need to be updated to reflect new features in the core or cms of Hotcakes, such as the UI changing.
